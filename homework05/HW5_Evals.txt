Evaluation for homework 05: Soccer Simulation

Ball and SoccerSim programs, also possible Timer program
Includes running Ball main to observe tests
Includes running Clock or Timer main to observe tests
Includes running automated ClockSolver tests
   View SoccerSimTests.bat to see test parameters used
   View testresults.txt to see resulting output
========================================================

A total of one point each for the following, except where noted):

test collision       : two balls collide stopping sim      -  1 point
remaining sim tests  : various other tests (3 total)       -  3 points

Total 34 out of 34 = 100% which is an A-plus

Nice work!
